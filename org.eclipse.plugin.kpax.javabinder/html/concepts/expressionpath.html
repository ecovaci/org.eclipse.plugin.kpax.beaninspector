<h1>JavaBean Path Expression</h1>
<h2>The JavaBean </h2>
<p>It is known that a <b>JavaBean</b> is 
a Java class following the  conventions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The class must have a public default constructor (with no arguments).</li>
<li>The class <i>properties</i> must be accessible using get, set, is (can be used for boolean properties instead of get), and other methods (so-called accessor methods and mutator methods) according to a standard naming convention. Setters can have one or more than one argument.</li>
<li>The class should be serializable.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Path Expression</h2>
<p>For a JavaBean, a <i>Path Expression</i> is a property navigation path. Such path is represented by a String made of dot-separated names of properties of the Java Bean class.<br>
For example, let's take the following JavaBeans:</p>
<pre>
class Country implements Serializable {
	private String code;
	private String label;
	
	//-- Accessor methods here
}

class Address implements Serializable {
	private Country country;
	private String town;
	
	//-- Accessor methods here
}

class Person implements Serializable {
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private Address address;
	
	//-- Accessor methods here
}
</pre>
<p>Some path expressions, considering the Person class as root, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>firstName</li>
<li>address</li>
<li>address.town</li>
<li>address.country.code</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we'll refer path expressions as <i>paths</i>.</p>
<h2>The JavaBean revisited</h2>
<p>Let us look back to the JavaBean definition from the path expressions perspective.<br>
It's obvious that the 1th and the 3th requirements have nothing to do with paths. That's why will keep only the 2th requirement.<br>
<em>Therefore, the JavaBean definition this plugin will take it is: any Java class or interface having at least one property.</em></p><br><br>
